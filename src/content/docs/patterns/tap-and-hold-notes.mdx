### Recommended Precursors:

- Finished set up for a .xdrv chart (file organization, metadata, and timing)
- Started patterning for a .xdrv chart
- Informed of general charting principles, including essential charting

*This article talks about many base game charts in XDRV, including some that need to be unlocked or are hidden. Spoilers ahead!*

Essential charting, the method of charting where common rhythm game patterns are used to represent a section’s rhythms, is dependent on some library of classic patterns existing. For XDRV, most of these patterns consist of tap and hold notes, as these notes are the most similar to the notes in other vertical-scrolling rhythm games (VSRGs). Including classic patterns in your chart can do a lot for it. Not only do classic patterns add a level of precision and flow to your charts, but they also ground your individual chart in the larger sphere of charting.

Balancing classic patterns and unique, song-accurate patterns is typically the best for the quality of charts. Striking this balance is largely about feeling. It’s important to consider that some classic patterns, including many of the ones to be listed below, have equal room for music sync as patterns constructed via other methods (e.g. pitch charting or sample charting). The history and recurrence of classic patterns across rhythm games just gives them a unique flavor and reception.
	Here are many of these patterns and their appearances in base-game charts:

Streams

Patterns where many notes of some consistent subdivision (often 16ths) have to be hit in quick succession. Does not take any specific shape, though you may see smaller instances of other patterns within a larger stream. Excessively long streams are often called “deathstreams.”
Use Examples: Luminous Race HY, Futari no Sekai EX
Holdstreams
Streams where the taps notes feel like holds. Plays practically the same as regular streams at a high enough BPM, but it contributes double the combo. Great for representing lesser subdivisions of notes that would be excessively difficult (ex. Represent 32nd kicks with a 16th holdstream)
Use Examples: Fly Wit Me EX, valor/starcross EX
Jumpstreams / Handstreams
Streams with doubles / chords placed at certain intervals (multiple notes on the same beat). The chords are typically placed to the rhythm of snares, kicks, or some other present sound. Also does not take any specific shape. Considerably harder than streams.
Use Examples: Fly Wit Me EX, We Out Here EX
Rolls
Patterns where the notes ascend the lanes in one direction at a consistent subdivision, requiring the player “roll” their hand across some inputs. Can use both hands or one hand.
Use Examples: Mahika HY, Station HY
Staircases
Patterns where the notes ascend and descend lanes at a consistent subdivision. Considerably harder than rolls since they make you hit the outermost keys of the staircase more frequently than the other keys.
Use Examples: Fly Wit Me HY

Trills
Patterns where the player must rapidly alternate between two notes. Can use both hands or one hand. Can be broken up with additional notes to represent a different percussion.
Use Examples: Frontliners HY, Candyland EX

Jacks
Patterns where two notes happen in the same lane in rapid succession, requiring the player to hit a key like a jackhammer (repeatedly and swiftly). Often reserved to a double input in one lane (known as a minijack).
Use Examples: Etiquette EX, City in the Clouds EX, Wonderblossom HY

Bursts
Patterns that alternate / throw in dense, short patterns that look like streams or trills at a smaller subdivision than the sections surrounding it.
Use Examples: We Out Here EX (24ths), DELTA ASCENDER HY, 
And So You Felt EX

Chords
Patterns where multiple notes land have the same timing and therefore must be hit simultaneously. Can either be one one side of the track (one-handed) or cover both sides of the track (two-handed).
Use Examples: Knights of Khronelia EX, Waiting HY, HYPRWARP HY

Chordholds
Chords where the notes are hold notes. Can all end on the same beat or be staggered to suggest the fading out of sound.
Use Examples: Wonderblossom HY, Fly Wit Me EX
Flams
Patterns that look like chords where some notes are delayed by a very small subdivision, but still grouped together visually.
Use Examples: Resurrection HY, valor/starcross HY/EX
Gallops
Groups of two notes with a small subdivision between then where larger subdivisions separate them. Can be on both hands or one hand.
Use Examples: City in the Clouds HY (1/16th→1/8th), 
Wonderblossom HY (1/12th→1/6th)
LN Charting
Patterns that utilize hold notes. Typically, these patterns have long notes run simultaneously with tap notes following a different pattern. Sometimes, hold notes replace tap notes in another pattern for emphasis or readability. As hold notes in XDRV lack release timing, more expressiveness is possible without skyrocketing difficulty.
Use Examples: Mahika HY, Rave Protocol EX,
No Tomorrow HY
Empty Space
Believe it or not, empty space can be a great tool for pacing a chart or emphasizing a part of a song. This is especially the case when you start implementing mods.
Use Examples: cybercrush perplex HY, Dreams From Another World EX

While trying to incorporate some of the above patterns can be a good thing, you should not try to compose your chart with only these basic patterns. Many songs would be poorly represented by these classic patterns alone. You should still be willing to invent new patterns, modify the patterns to fit your song, combine a number of patterns into a larger section. Pure classic patterns are best used in moderation.
