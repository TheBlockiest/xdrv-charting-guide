Radar values are an important part of the presentation of XDRV charts. With a quick glance, a player can look at the radar value of a chart and immediately discern a few things about it: what the most prominent type of pattern is, whether or not a chart is very mod-heavy, even how difficult the chart will be (on a different scale than the numeric difficulty system). Because radar values are a useful tool for players, it is often valuable for charters to think about them and how players will perceive them.
Charters can use radars to inform if their chart is approximately accurate to the numeric difficulty they assigned. This can be best determined by comparing the radar values of official charts with your custom. For instance, if you assign a chart a difficulty of 12, but the chart’s radar looks more like a 14, you may have misrated your chart’s difficulty. Note that chart radars do not directly correlate to the difficulties assigned; although chart radars can be a solid indicator of specific elements of difficulty, they may miss part of a chart’s difficulty that the charter can more easily identify.

## Radar Value Categories
 
Radar values, shaped like a pentagon, have 5 different categories: Density, Peak, Chord, Tech, and Gimmick. Each category is calculated by looking at a specific factor of the chart. By changing specific factors of your chart, it is technically possible to manipulate your chart’s radar values by changing your chart in specific ways. Be careful, however, as no change is worth worsening your chart’s quality.

### Density

Density increases as the number of notes and gears in a chart increases. The density value increases further for note and gear counts that are not a part of chords. One important factor that density considers is the longest consecutive stream in the chart–the longer the stream, the greater the contribution to density. Density also considers song length.

If you want to increase Density, your best bet is to add more singular notes, potentially by making streams in your chart longer. If you want to increase density, you can typically accomplish this by breaking up continuous note streams at points of lessened emphasis.

### Peak

The main factor that Peak takes is the max of the notes and gears per second of the chat. Both the max of notes per second with and without chords is considered, though max notes per second without chords is weighted much higher. Peak also factors in the BPM of a song, capping at 300.

If you want to increase Peak, your best bet is to add more notes. If you want to decrease Peak, your best bet is to remove or simplify note patterns. This can be most effectively accomplished by decreasing quantization. If you have 32nd bursts in your chart, replacing them with 16th holdstreams will drop the Peak value noticeably.

### Chord

The Chord value is largely calculated based on the amount of chords in a chart, up to a certain threshold determined by the length of the chart. Of all categories, it is arguably the most simple.

Increasing Chord is as simple as adding more chords, while decreasing Chord is as simple as removing some. Make sure that any chords you add or remove make sense in terms of emphasis.

### Tech

The Tech value, in stark contrast to Chord, is the most complicated radar value of all five. The Tech value of a chart accounts for all of the following: total drift time, number of gears, number of crosshands, amount of one-handedness, number of note-gear chords, and even mines. The higher in volume that these elements are, the greater the chart’s tech value will be.

For the sake of brevity, Tech can be increased by adding more of these elements, while Tech can be decreased by removing some of these elements.

### Gimmick

There are three separate categories of factors that impact the Gimmick value of a chart; timing segments, mines, and mods. Timing events are the various tags that go in the .xdrv file (#STOP, #WARP, #BPM, #TIME_SIGNATURE), while mods are taken from the function calls made in the .lua file corresponding to your chart. Each timing event and mod scales contributes a different amount to the Gimmick value. Furthermore, mods scale off of their intensity.

To increase Gimmick, your best bet is to either add more mods or increase the intensity of pre-existing ones. Typically, any sort of event you can call on a for loop (e.g. track bounces, note scale pulses) can contribute a lot to Gimmick rating with minimal effort. Alternatively, you can decrease Gimmick by removing or decreasing the intensity of mods. When changing intensity, bear in mind that mods can become too weak or too strong if you are not careful.

Understanding how chart radars are calculated can be useful in many ways. Looking at the chart radar can help you gauge your chart’s own difficulty. It may also encourage you to focus on one of the categories when designing a chart, which many base-game charts do. Above all else, the chart radar is an informational resource for players sight-reading your chart. It’s okay to tweak your chart in order to achieve a desired radar value, but it is important to be careful when doing so. Hasty changes can undermine the quality of your chart.
