A significant part of XDRV charting is the community that has formed and will continue to grow around it. Though most charts are made by one person, the larger community still leaves their mark on each individual contribution–giving feedback and praise, setting scores, playtesting, and even taking inspiration for future charts. Involvement in the charting community via the community Discord is a great way to build friendships and share your hard work. As with any community-based activity, there are actions that you can take to show respect to other charters. Many of these actions are in regard to what you choose to chart and how you respond to other people’s charts.

## Giving / Receiving Feedback

For charters who want to improve, receiving and giving feedback is an important part of the charting process. With that said, not all individuals want to receive feedback on their charts. Some people may find that feedback, whether constructive or destructive, heavily demotivates their ability to create; others may not want feedback on specific charts which they feel are “complete.” If you want to give feedback on a person’s chart, ensure that said person has put the “Feedback Requested” tag on their chart. When giving feedback, do your best to be constructive in your criticism, and avoid bloating your feedback with negativity; often, it is much more productive to point out one or two things you dislike, plus at least one thing that you enjoy.

Consequently, if you want to receive feedback on a chart that you make, make sure that you put the “Feedback Requested” tag on it. It is totally fine to post a chart without requesting feedback. Bear in mind, however, that this decision may limit how people can interact with your charts.

If you receive feedback on a chart, it is wholly your choice whether or not you adjust your chart accordingly. Sometimes, you would prefer to start a new chart with the information you’ve learned, and that is completely fine and without downside. (You can always rechart your less refined content down the line.) If you choose to implement feedback, however, give yourself time to process it all, and feel free to ask those who gave you feedback for elaboration.

Claiming Songs

In some instances of people making XDRV charts, the charter may choose to post about what song they are charting or going to chart prior to the chart being done. This is known as claiming a song. Typically, song claims are done to ensure that other people do not chart the same song as you. Song claims also can help build hype early on and give charters a space to share their progress. While these advantages of claiming songs are all present, there are some key downsides:

- Claiming songs too early and not following through with charting the song can result in a song never being charted.
- Creating posts for claimed songs can bloat the forum channel, which can make it difficult for people who want to browse and download custom charts.
- Claiming a song implies that multiple people charting the same song is bad, which is not necessarily the case (see next section).
- Claiming a song may imply that you have some ownership or exclusivity towards, which (unless you genuinely do) you don’t.

If you want to claim a song for any reason, your best bet is to do so when you have made considerable progress with your chart. Having a semi-cleaned draft of your difficulty’s patterns done prior to posting is ideal.

If you would prefer to tease a chart without fully committing to it or bloating the forum channel, consider making a post in the #charting-discussion channel instead. If you do this, still try to have made considerable progress with your chart prior.

## Charting Previously-Charted Songs

At some point in your charting experience, you may find that a song that you wish to chart has already been charted by someone in the past. While the intention of charters claiming songs is typically to dissuade or avoid this, it is important to consider that multiple people charting the same song is typically a sign of a healthy charting community. Furthermore, (in nearly all instances) no singular charter owns the rights to a song; if one person can chart a song, then another person can go through the same process with that song and also be able to chart it.

Multiple charts of the same song can create bloat, especially when few charts exist. It’s best to have a good reason for charting a song charted before:

- The original chart is old and no longer reflective of current XDRV charting standards.
- You want to take your chart beyond the scale of the original (by multidiffing, adding mods, charting a song’s full version).
- The original chart is not controller friendly, and you want to make a controller friendly chart of the song (or vice versa).

### Forking

Forking is the process of taking a chart that another person has made, modifying it to some extent, and then reuploading the chart as your own. In nearly all instances, forking without permission is frowned upon, as it takes artistic agency away from the original charter and implies that you could do “better” than the original charter. You can technically ask for permission to fork, but you would probably be better off starting a chart of the song from scratch. In short, don’t fork.

## Referencing Other Customs

At some point in your charting experience, you may want to reference another charter’s chart files, mod files, or any other text files made for XDRV. Not only is this completely okay to do, but it is generally a great way to learn how to do certain effects or mods. Copying helper functions can also be helpful, though you should be careful as to not copy helper functions too specific to one chart–that may look like plagiarism to the original charter and outside players. For your own experience, try to play through a chart’s content before referencing its files. Furthermore, if you want to reference a chart, consider interacting with the chart’s forum post prior.

## Other Good Practices

	Listed in no particular order, here are other good practices for charting and contributing charts in the community server:

- Attribute song and jacket artists as thoroughly and accurately as possible.
- Add proper metadata to your charts. For instance, if your song comes from a different game, fill in MUSIC_CREDIT. If your song is a shortened version of a longer song, fill in SUBTITLE.
- Do not share low-quality charts solely for the purpose of being low quality, especially if the song being used was not made in a similar nature.
- If a piece of media is obscenely offensive or harmful, do not share a chart containing it on the community Discord.
- Do not share content on the Discord that you do not have permission to chart (see [42] Getting Song Perms).
- Do not use AI-generated media in your charts.

With time, the XDRV community will evolve, taking on new charters of different interests and norms. Furthermore, some nuances that exist now and may exist in the future are not wholly captured by this document. While following the guidelines here will allow you to contribute positively to the XDRV charting community, the best way to familiarize yourself with and become a part of the community is to be active. There are many ways to do this, including answering questions in #charting-discussion, posting feedback and scoreposts under individual forum posts, and even interacting with base-game XDRV.
