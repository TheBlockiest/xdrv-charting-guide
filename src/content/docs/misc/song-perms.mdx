Before you chart any song for XDRV, you should make sure that you have permission from the artist to chart it. If you are not permitted by the artist to use their song, you cannot distribute or post about the chart on the XDRV community server. The only way to be able to distribute an XDRV chart of a song on the community server is to get permission from the song’s artist. This can be in the form of general permission or charter-specific permission.

## Acceptable General Permissions

General permissions are a statement by an artist that certain songs can be used, provided that the usage falls within specific guidelines. These permissions can take a number of different forms.

### Creative Commons Licenses

Creative commons licenses are a type of license that artists put on their songs. If a song is licensed under a Creative Commons License, you should be able to use it in XDRV without issue. With that said, each symbol has its own ramifications.

A singularly **CC** license allows for anyone to use a given song for any purpose. This, of course, includes charting. For this and all other CC licenses, you should still be respectful of any artist wishes that bypass normal goal

A CC license containing **BY** requires that you properly credit the artist for their song. You should be doing this with all of your charts, so there are no special measures you have to take.

A CC license containing **NC** requires that you not use the song for any commercial purposes. XDRV already does not allow charts made for monetary purposes, so once again, no special measures need be taken.

A CC license containing **SA** is a “share-alike” clause and requires you to put your chart under the same CC license as the song being used. This license interacts oddly with general charting etiquette, but in short, your ownership of a chart made to a CC-SA song is slightly compromised. You are still free to chart the song, however.

A CC license containing **ND** is a “no derivatives” clause and requires you to not remix, transform, or build upon the song. Most readings of ND count custom charts as derivative works. Therefore, you must reach out to the artist for invidiaul permission if you want to use a CC-ND song.

## General Charting Permissions

Many artists have website pages, social media posts, or digital documents allowing charters to use their music in custom content for many rhythm games, potentially including XDRV. If you want to use an artist’s music, check if they have given general charting permissions prior to emailing them. Also ensure that these permissions include XDRV. If an artist allows their songs to be used in charts for non-commercial games, for instance, XDRV is covered. If an artist only allows their songs to be used in one game, alternatively, XDRV is not automatically covered.

If you are looking for information about song usage on an artist’s website, look for a page about “Guidelines” or “Song Use.” In many instances, this page is linked on the contact page of the artist’s website (typically to intercept people from contacting them about song usage). Be cautious when using machine translations for websites written in other languages, as small, key details can get misconstrued.

Many artists specify non-commercial and personal use of their songs. All XDRV custom charts fulfill non-commercial use, as both the base game and any customs made for the game are free to play. Typically, personal use means that the creative entity making and distributing the work is an individual or an informal group of individuals. Again, XDRV customs fulfill this clause in most cases.

Artists will also occasionally attach general song permissions on link-aggregate services (such as Linktree) or give brief permissions in the descriptions of their accounts (including Bandcamp).

Obtaining Individual Permissions

If you are unable to find general permissions for a singular song and are still interested in charting that song, you can then contact them and ask for permission. Here are the steps you can use to contact an artist:

1. Find an appropriate way to contact them. Typically, the best way to contact an artist is by sending them an email. If you share a mutual server with an artist on Discord, you may want to message them there instead. Various other methods of contact are valid, including through the “Contact [ARTIST NAME]” button on their Bandcamp (if they have one). Do not ask for permission to chart a song on a public post.
2. Put together a message to be sent to the artist. Consider using the template provided on the XDRV community server. If you do not want to use the template, make sure your message:
	- Addresses the artist by name
	- Includes the song that you want to chart
	- Acknowledges that you are making a custom level
	- Acknowledges that their song will not be used to make money in any way
	- Provides a link to XDRV’s website and/or Steam listing
	- Mentions the “custom content whitelist” and provides the cooresponding email
3. Proofread the message, and then send it.
4. Give the artist ample time to respond. If they do not respond after 1-2 weeks, feel free to follow up. Beyond that, however, do not contact them again unless circumstances have meaningfully changed.

There are some ways that you can improve the likelihood that you get a response–writing a clear email, selecting a song you can purchase, and even selecting an artist already familiar with or already having contributed music to XDRV. Bear in mind, however, that regardless of prior circumstances, there is no guarantee that you get permission to chart a song in XDRV. Artists have a right to the music they produce; if they do not want their song being used for free, such should be respected. 

### Message Content: What to Include

You may have a few questions about what you should or should not include, especially if you are starting with the template. Here are some questions and answers:

- *Can I add things to the template?* Of course, but bear in mind that the template excels at conveying exactly the information that it needs to. Avoid adding too much on top of it.
- *Should I introduce myself?* I like to because it feels more formal.
- *Should I state that I am a fan of the artist’s music?* It doesn’t hurt to, though that is practically a given. Consider keeping it to a brief message if/when you choose to introduce yourself.
- *Should I state what I like about the song I want to chart?* Once again, it doesn’t hurt, but it is a bit superfluous.
- *Should I share my plans for the chart?* Unless you are trying to use your plans as leverage (not much exists there), I advise not. Artists typically won’t mind you using the chart in a larger project, provided that you got permission to chart the song and didn’t inform them of different plans.
- *Do I need to ask for permission to use the jacket as well?* You shouldn’t have to. Typically, song permissions transfer to the jacket art. If you credit the jacket illustrator properly, you shouldn’t have any issues.
- *Can I exclude the “custom chart whitelist” info?* Again, I would advise not. It only takes a small, separate paragraph, and it opens up the potential for other charters to use their music in the future.

Obtaining permission to chart songs might appear like a major obstacle at first, but understanding where and how to get song permissions makes it far easier. Despite first impressions, there are many different songs you can chart without even having to send an email–all you have to do is look. If you find that your individual song usage requests are taking some time, consider charting a song with general permissions in the meantime. That way, you can continually improve your charting skills and produce new charts while you wait for permission for other songs to potentially come back. And again, remember that there is no guarantee that you get permission to chart a song in XDRV, regardless of prior circumstances.
